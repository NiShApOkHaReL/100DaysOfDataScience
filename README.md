# 100 Days of Data Science

Welcome to my "100 Days of Data Science" journey!

## Day 1: Introduction to Python Basics

### Topics Covered:
0Ô∏è‚É£ **Comments, Datatypes, Numbers, Casting:**
   - **Comments:** Annotations in code for explanations, marked with `#`.
   - **Datatypes:** Categories of values, like `int` for integers, `float` for decimals, and `str` for strings.
   - **Numbers:** Integers (`int`) and floating-point numbers (`float`) for calculations.
   - **Casting:** Changing a value's datatype, e.g., `str(5)` converts integer 5 to string "5".

1Ô∏è‚É£ **String, Booleans, Operators:**
   - **String:** Sequence of characters, like `"Hello, World!"`.
   - **Booleans:** True (`True`) or false (`False`) values for logical comparisons.
   - **Operators:** Symbols like `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `==` for equality checks.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **List, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries:**
   - **List:** Ordered collection enclosed in square brackets, e.g., `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`.
   - **Tuples:** Similar to lists but enclosed in parentheses, e.g., `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`.
   - **Sets:** Unordered unique items enclosed in curly braces, e.g., `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`.
   - **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces, e.g., `my_dict = {"key": "value"}`.


## Day 2: Exploring Python Functions

### Topics Covered:
üìù **Python Function:** A block of statements that performs a specific task and returns a value.
   
0Ô∏è‚É£ **Types of Functions:**
   - Built-in functions provided by Python.
   - User-defined functions created by programmers.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Types of Function Arguments:**
   - Positional arguments passed in the order they are defined.
   - Keyword arguments identified by parameter names.
   - Default arguments with predefined values.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Docstring:**
   - A string placed at the beginning of a function to provide documentation.
   - Describes the purpose and usage of the function.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Anonymous Function:**
   - Also known as lambda functions.
   - Used for short, simple operations without creating a formal function.
   
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Nested Function:**
   - A function defined within another function.
   - Encapsulation allows for better organization and reusability.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **While Loop:**
   - Executes a block of code repeatedly while a condition is true.
   - Useful for tasks where the number of iterations isn't known in advance.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **If..Else, For Loops:**
   - **If..Else:** Conditional statements to execute code based on conditions.
   - **For Loops:** Iterating over a sequence (like a list) to repeat code for each item.
