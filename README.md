# 100 Days of Data Science

Welcome to my "100 Days of Data Science" journey!

## Day 1: Introduction to Python Basics

### Topics Covered:
0️⃣ **Comments, Datatypes, Numbers, Casting:**
   - **Comments:** Annotations in code for explanations, marked with `#`.
   - **Datatypes:** Categories of values, like `int` for integers, `float` for decimals, and `str` for strings.
   - **Numbers:** Integers (`int`) and floating-point numbers (`float`) for calculations.
   - **Casting:** Changing a value's datatype, e.g., `str(5)` converts integer 5 to string "5".

1️⃣ **String, Booleans, Operators:**
   - **String:** Sequence of characters, like `"Hello, World!"`.
   - **Booleans:** True (`True`) or false (`False`) values for logical comparisons.
   - **Operators:** Symbols like `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `==` for equality checks.

2️⃣ **List, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries:**
   - **List:** Ordered collection enclosed in square brackets, e.g., `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`.
   - **Tuples:** Similar to lists but enclosed in parentheses, e.g., `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`.
   - **Sets:** Unordered unique items enclosed in curly braces, e.g., `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`.
   - **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces, e.g., `my_dict = {"key": "value"}`.
3️⃣ **If..Else, For Loops:**
   - **If..Else:** Conditional statements to execute code based on conditions.
   - **For Loops:** Iterating over a sequence (like a list) to repeat code for each item.


## Day 2: Exploring Python Functions

### Topics Covered:
📝 **Python Function:** A block of statements that performs a specific task and returns a value.
   
0️⃣ **Types of Functions:**
   - Built-in functions provided by Python.
   - User-defined functions created by programmers.

1️⃣ **Types of Function Arguments:**
   - Positional arguments passed in the order they are defined.
   - Keyword arguments identified by parameter names.
   - Default arguments with predefined values.

2️⃣ **Docstring:**
   - A string placed at the beginning of a function to provide documentation.
   - Describes the purpose and usage of the function.

3️⃣ **Anonymous Function:**
   - Also known as lambda functions.
   - Used for short, simple operations without creating a formal function.
   
4️⃣ **Nested Function:**
   - A function defined within another function.
   - Encapsulation allows for better organization and reusability.

5️⃣ **While Loop:**
   - Executes a block of code repeatedly while a condition is true.
   - Useful for tasks where the number of iterations isn't known in advance.

## Day 3: Exploring Advanced Python Concepts

### Topics Covered:
🖥️ **Map Functions:**
   - `map()` in Python is an iterator that applies a function to every item in an iterable (e.g., tuple, list) and returns a new iterable with results.

🧹 **Filter Function:**
   - `filter()` creates an iterator by applying a function to items in an iterable and returning only items that satisfy a certain condition.

📚 **Arrays:**
   - Python doesn't have native arrays, but you can use lists to achieve similar functionality.

🔧 **Array Methods:**
   - Python lists come with built-in methods to manipulate and interact with data efficiently.

🧬 **Class and Object:**
   - Objects are data bundles containing variables and methods.
   - A class serves as a blueprint to create objects with specific attributes and behaviors.

### Acknowledgments:
I'd like to extend my gratitude to W3Schools.com and GeeksforGeeks for providing valuable resources that assisted me in today's learning.


## Day 4: Deepening Python Proficiency

### Topics Explored:
0. **Exception Handling:**
   - Understand how exceptions can disrupt normal program execution.
   - Learn to handle exceptions gracefully with `try` and `except` blocks.

1. **Custom Exceptions:**
   - Explore the creation of custom exceptions to tailor error handling to specific needs.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - Dive into inheritance, a key concept allowing one class to inherit attributes and methods from another.

3. **The Super() Function:**
   - Uncover the power of `super()`, which enables child classes to inherit methods and properties from their parents.

### Special Thanks:
I'd like to express my appreciation to W3Schools.com and GeeksforGeeks for providing invaluable insights that facilitated my learning today.

## Day 5: Exploring Iterators, Iterables, and Polymorphism

### Topics Covered:
0. **Iterables vs Iterators:**
   - Grasped the distinction between iterators and iterables.
   - In Python, an iterable is any object that can be looped over, like lists or strings.
   - An iterator is a specific kind of iterable that provides an interface for retrieving elements sequentially using the `__next__()` method.

1. **Polymorphism:**
   - Dived into polymorphism, a pivotal concept enhancing code flexibility and reusability.
   - Explored the ability to treat different objects as instances of a common superclass, simplifying code through a uniform interface.

## Day 6: Further Exploring Python Programming

### Topics Explored:
0. **Access Modifiers:**
   - Explored access modifiers that control the visibility of variables and methods in classes.
   - Discovered the significance of public, private, and protected access levels, enhancing security.

1. **Encapsulation:**
   - Learned about encapsulation, where I encapsulated data and methods within classes.
   - Discovered the benefits of encapsulation in promoting clean, organized, and modular code.

2. **Constructors and Destructors:**
   - Dived into constructors, special methods that initialize objects during creation.
   - Uncovered destructors, which perform cleanup operations before objects are destroyed or go out of scope.

3. **File Handling:**
   - Ventured into the realm of file handling, mastering the art of reading and writing data to files.
   - Explored interactions with files to store and retrieve data effectively.

### Grateful for Assistance:
I owe a debt of gratitude to ChatGPT for its assistance on my learning journey.

### Embrace Learning:
Remember, each day brings a wealth of new knowledge. Stay curious, stay enthusiastic, and happy learning! 😊


## Day 7: Embarking on the Journey with Pandas

### Topics Explored:
After dedicating 6 days to learning Python programming, today I immersed myself in the world of Pandas, a prominent Python library.

📘 **Pandas Overview:**
   - Delved into Pandas, an open-source Python library designed for data manipulation and analysis.
   - Widely employed in data science, machine learning, and various domains for efficient data handling and analysis.
   - Named "pandas" due to its focus on multidimensional structured data sets.

📊 **Pandas Data Structures:**
   - Explored the fundamental data structures provided by Pandas: Series and DataFrame.

0️⃣ **Pandas DataFrame:**
   - Unveiled the versatile two-dimensional data structure, resembling a table or SQL table.
   - Consisting of rows and columns, each column can have distinct data types.
   - Enables diverse operations like filtering, grouping, aggregating, merging, and more.

1️⃣ **Pandas Series:**
   - Introduced the concept of a one-dimensional labeled array.
   - Accompanied by an index to label each element, akin to a single column of data with labels.
