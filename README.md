   - **Booleans:** True (`True`) or false (`False`) values for logical comparisons.
   - **Operators:** Symbols like `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `==` for equality checks.

2️⃣ **List, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries:**
   - **List:** Ordered collection enclosed in square brackets, e.g., `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`.
   - **Tuples:** Similar to lists but enclosed in parentheses, e.g., `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`.
   - **Sets:** Unordered unique items enclosed in curly braces, e.g., `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`.
   - **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces, e.g., `my_dict = {"key": "value"}`.
     
3️⃣ **If..Else, For Loops:**

   - `map()` in Python is an iterator that applies a function to every item in an iterable (e.g., tuple, list) and returns a new iterable with results.

🧹 **Filter Function:**
   - `filter()` creates an iterator by applying a function to items in an iterable and returning only items that satisfy a certain condition.

📚 **Arrays:**
   - Python doesn't have native arrays, but you can use lists to achieve similar functionality.

🔧 **Array Methods:**
   - Python lists come with built-in methods to manipulate and interact with data efficiently.
